# AI-to-Human Editing Checklist

✅ Remove repetitive phrases (e.g., "In conclusion", "Overall").  
✅ Replace vague words ("things", "stuff") with specifics.  
✅ Add personal touches (stories, mini-examples).  
✅ Vary sentence lengths — mix short & long.  
✅ Use contractions (you're, don't, it's).  
✅ Avoid robotic transitions ("Moreover", "Furthermore" every time).  
✅ Check if tone feels warm, curious, and natural.
