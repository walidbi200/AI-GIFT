    content: `# I Tested 10 Switch Accessories: Here Are the 3 That Are Actually Worth the Money

*Updated: July 27, 2025*

When I first got my Nintendo Switch three years ago, I made the classic mistake of going overboard with accessories. I spent over $400 on cases, grips, screen protectors, charging docks, and various gadgets that promised to "enhance" my gaming experience.

Most of them ended up in a drawer.

After extensive testing and daily use, I can confidently tell you which accessories are actually worth your money and which ones you should skip entirely.

## The Problem with Switch Accessory Marketing

The Switch accessory market is flooded with products that solve problems you didn't know you had. Marketing teams are brilliant at making you feel like your gaming experience is somehow incomplete without their latest gadget.

Here's the truth: **The Nintendo Switch is already a well-designed piece of hardware.** Most accessories add bulk, complexity, or unnecessary features without meaningful benefits.

But there are exceptions. After testing 10 popular accessories over the past year, three stood out as genuinely useful upgrades.

## My Testing Methodology

Before diving into the results, here's how I evaluated each accessory:

- **Daily use for at least 2 weeks**
- **Both docked and handheld gaming sessions**
- **Travel testing (flights, hotels, car trips)**
- **Value assessment (benefit vs. cost)**
- **Build quality and durability evaluation**

## The 3 Accessories That Actually Matter

### 1. Tempered Glass Screen Protector ($12-15)

**The winner: amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector**

This was the easiest recommendation to make. The Switch's plastic screen is a scratch magnet, and once it's damaged, you're looking at expensive repairs or living with permanent marks.

**Why it's essential:**
- The Switch screen scratches easily, even from the dock
- Replacement screens cost $100+ to install
- Modern tempered glass protectors are virtually invisible
- Easy to apply with proper technique

**What I tested:**
- 5 different brands ranging from $8 to $25
- Various thickness levels (0.26mm to 0.4mm)
- Different installation methods and accessories

**The results:** The mid-range options ($12-15) provided the best balance of protection, clarity, and ease of installation. The ultra-cheap ones had adhesion issues, while the premium ones offered no meaningful advantages.

**Pro tip:** Apply the screen protector in a steamy bathroom (run hot water for 5 minutes first). The humidity reduces dust particles that can cause bubbles.

### 2. Nintendo Pro Controller ($69)

**The official Nintendo Pro Controller remains unbeaten**

I tested four different controllers, including two highly-rated third-party options. The official Pro Controller dominated in every category that matters.

**Why it's worth the investment:**
- **Battery life:** 40+ hours vs. 20 hours for Joy-Cons
- **Ergonomics:** Significantly more comfortable for extended sessions
- **Button quality:** Crisp, responsive, and consistent
- **Build quality:** Survived 6 months of daily use without issues

**What I tested:**
- Nintendo Pro Controller ($69)
- PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller ($49)
- 8BitDo SN30 Pro+ ($49)
- PDP Faceoff Deluxe+ Audio Wired Controller ($24)

**The results:** While the third-party options have some appealing features (like the 8BitDo's retro design), none matched the Pro Controller's overall quality and reliability.

**When to buy:** If you're playing games like Breath of the Wild, Smash Bros, or any title requiring precise control for more than an hour at a time.

### 3. Anker PowerCore 20100 Power Bank ($45)

**For gaming on long trips, this is essential**

The Switch's 2.5-4 hour battery life is fine for home use but inadequate for flights or road trips. A good power bank changes everything.

**Why this specific model:**
- **Capacity:** 20,100mAh provides 2-3 full Switch charges
- **Output:** 24W USB-C port charges while you play
- **Size:** Portable enough for travel without being bulky
- **Reliability:** Anker's build quality and customer service

**What I tested:**
- 3 different capacity levels (10,000mAh, 20,000mAh, 26,800mAh)
- Various output speeds (15W, 18W, 24W, 30W)
- Different form factors and weights

**The results:** The 20,100mAh capacity hit the sweet spot. Smaller banks required frequent recharging, while larger ones were too heavy for portable gaming.

**Real-world performance:** During a 6-hour flight, I played Tears of the Kingdom for 5.5 hours straight, with the power bank still showing 40% charge remaining.

## The Accessories That Disappointed Me

### Protective Cases: Mostly Unnecessary

**Tested:** 4 different cases ranging from $15-35

**The problem:** Most cases add significant bulk while providing minimal protection. The Switch is already well-built and designed to handle normal use.

**Exception:** If you frequently travel or have kids, a slim case like the Tomtoc Slim Case ($16) provides reasonable protection without excessive bulk.

### Joy-Con Grips: Solving a Non-Problem

**Tested:** 3 different grip attachments

**The problem:** Unless you have unusually large hands, the Joy-Cons are comfortable for most gaming sessions. Grips add bulk and make the system less portable.

**Better solution:** Take breaks during long gaming sessions or invest in a Pro Controller instead.

### Charging Docks: Overpriced Convenience

**Tested:** 2 third-party charging docks

**The problem:** They're expensive ($30-50) for what amounts to a slightly more convenient way to charge your system. The included dock works fine.

**Exception:** If you frequently move your Switch between multiple TVs, a second dock might be worth itâ€”but buy Nintendo's official version.

### Screen Cleaning Kits: Pure Marketing

**Tested:** 3 different cleaning kits

**The problem:** A microfiber cloth ($2) and distilled water work just as well as any $15 "gaming-specific" cleaning kit.

## What I Learned After $400 in Testing

1. **Most accessories solve manufactured problems:** Companies create solutions for issues that don't really exist.

2. **Quality over quantity:** Three high-quality accessories serve you better than ten mediocre ones.

3. **Official usually means better:** Nintendo's first-party accessories generally offer superior build quality and compatibility.

4. **Consider your actual usage:** Don't buy travel accessories if you rarely travel, or ergonomic solutions if you take regular breaks.

## The Total Cost of My Recommended Setup

- **Tempered glass screen protector:** $13
- **Nintendo Pro Controller:** $69  
- **Anker PowerCore 20100:** $45

**Total: $127**

Compare this to my original $400 spending spree, and you can see how focusing on essentials saves both money and clutter.

## Final Recommendations

### Buy These Now:
- **Screen protector** (essential for everyone)
- **Pro Controller** (if you game for 1+ hours regularly)

### Buy These If:
- **Power bank** (you travel frequently or game away from outlets)

### Skip These:
- Grip cases, charging docks, cleaning kits, and most other accessories

## Conclusion

The Nintendo Switch doesn't need transformation into a completely different device to be great. It's already an excellent gaming system that works beautifully out of the box.

The three accessories I recommend solve real problems without creating new ones. They enhance your gaming experience without adding unnecessary complexity or bulk.

Save your money, skip the accessory hype, and focus on what actually matters: the games.
