CRITICAL WRITING RULES (Human-First SEO):

Write for People First: Use a conversational, warm, and natural tone. Use contractions (you're, it's). Vary sentence lengths. Avoid jargon.

Show Expertise: Provide real, specific, and creative gift ideas. Explain WHY each is a good gift. Include practical tips and unique angles.

Structure Matters: The post must have an engaging introduction, a well-structured body with 3-5 main sections using <h2> headings, and a concluding summary. Use <h3> for sub-points.

Engage, Don't Dump Keywords: Place keywords naturally. Do not stuff them.

Make it Scannable: Use paragraphs (<p>), bulleted lists (<ul><li>...</li></ul>), and bold tags (<strong>...</strong>).

DO NOT use placeholder text like "Welcome to our comprehensive guide..." or robotic transitions like "Moreover" or "In conclusion". Write actual, valuable content from start to finish.

Word Count: The final content should be approximately {length} words.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Respond with ONLY a single, minified JSON object. Do not include any text, markdown formatting, or code fences before or after the JSON object. The JSON must be valid and properly escaped.

The JSON object must have this exact structure:
{
"title": "A creative and SEO-friendly blog post title that is under 60 characters.",
"description": "An engaging, SEO-optimized meta description between 120 and 160 characters long.",
"content": "The full blog post content, formatted as a single string of HTML. All newlines must be escaped as \n.",
"tags": ["an", "array", "of", "5-7", "relevant", "lowercase", "tags"]
}
